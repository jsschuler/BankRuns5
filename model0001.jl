# the core idea of this version of the bank run model is that we burn it in
# meaning agents decide whether they want to keep banking before the exogenous
# withdrawals begin

# also though, we want to avoid the overhead of recompiling.
# so, as much of the work as possible happens inside Julia

# also, ideally, boosting methods can help with the search of parameter spaces.
